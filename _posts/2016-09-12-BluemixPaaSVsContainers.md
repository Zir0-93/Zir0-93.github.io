One of the most important decisions regarding the development of any software application revolves around the 
choice of technology used to host and run the application in production. Moreover, when we talk about cloud applications, the number
of vendors and solutions that can used for hosting drastically increases. This article will compare the **performance** between the 
PaaS and Container based deployment solutions provided by the IBM cloud in order to help individuals make more informed 
decisions when deploying their applications. Please not that performance is not the only indicator of whether you should use PaaS vs Containers
and the results were collected using the IBM Cloud (do keep in mind however that Bluemix's PaaS is based of Pivotal's Cloud Foundry).
