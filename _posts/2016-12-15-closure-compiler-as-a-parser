From the Closure Compiler website:
```
The Closure Compiler is a tool for making JavaScript download and run faster. Instead of compiling from a source language to 
machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead 
code and rewrites and minimizes what's left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about 
common JavaScript pitfalls.
```

### Closure Compiler As A JavaScript Parser
With a few modifications, the Google Closure-Compiler Java API can also be consumed to perform static analysis on JavaScript code.
We will create a simple JavaScript parser that will output the names of all the classes in a given JavaScript program.

```
public class JavaScriptParserPass extends AbstractPostOrderCallback implements CompilerPass {

    @Override
    public void process(Node externs, Node root) {
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node parent) {
        if (n.isClass()) {
            System.out.println("Class: " + n.);
        }
    }
}
