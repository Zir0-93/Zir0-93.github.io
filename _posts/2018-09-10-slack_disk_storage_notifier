description: Integrations are what takes Slack from a normal online instant messaging and collaboration system to a solution that enables you to centralize
all your notifications, from sales to tech support, social media and more, into one searchable place where your team can discuss
and take action on each. In this article, we're going to develop a simple bash script that reports local disk storage levels to Slack at a continuous time interval.
It is easily deployable to multiple instances, highly configurable, and can helps teams to take proactive measures in maintaining
the operational well-being of their systems.
