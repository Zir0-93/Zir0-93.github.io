At Clarity Views we belive visualizations can be a great way to comprehend software architecture. However, these visualizations need
to interact with developer by answering important questions and demonstrating key architectural properties. With Clarity Views, any
method or class level element within a diagram can be selected to view type information and example usages. We believe this is a great
way to combine the benefits of the architectural insights provided by class diagrams along with the benefits from viewing lower level
implementation details - all from a single view, right in your browser.
