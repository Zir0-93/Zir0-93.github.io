*Serverless* is the new Buzz word in town, selling developers the ability to focus on writing applications instead of managing servers. 

This is true for the most part, but Serverless apps also have a certain property that can make their deployment and maintenance time consuming. That is, they depend on services - lots of them. A serverless architecture is typically designed over services for storing data, load balancing, data caching and code execution, just to name a few. 

With that said, how do you both provision infrastructure and deploy code to test/staging/production environments in an **automated** and **risk-minimized** way?

If you can't answer this question easily, or some part of your deploys still require you to look at your cloud provider's console, then this post is for you.
