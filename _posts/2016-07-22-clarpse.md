[Clarpse](http://clarityviews.ca/github/Zir0-93/clarpse) is a multi-language source code analysis tool designed for extracting deep relationships between entities in a codebase through a clean API. Clarpse makes developer tools like code search and static analyzers better. It supports the development of features like jump to definition, find usages, type inference, and documentation generation.

## The Problem
Existing tools for parsing code like the [Eclipse JDT AST Parser](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.core), [JavaParser](http://clarityviews.ca/github/javaparser/javaparser) and [Roaster](http://clarityviews.ca/github/forge/roaster?projectName=impl) to name a few for Java simply provide information from generated AST's through Node visitors and event listeners. They are great at telling you about properties of an individual source file but if your requirements involve understanding components in the context of the entire codebase in order to support complex functionality you would typically need to develop your own solution. Additionally, because there are no standard cross-language and cross-editor APIs and data formats, it is difficult to reuse your work for more than one programming language.
 
## Let Clarpse Do The Hard Work
Clarpse acts as a layer infront of generated AST's to populage language agnostic source code models with all type and symbol information resolved at parse time. It exposes a clean, easy to use api and outputs data using a well defined, language independant format. All external tools built on top of Clarpse only need to consume this data format in order to support all the languages Clarpse supports! Here are some benefits of using Clarpse:

#### 1 - No more messy procedural code to manipulate AST's, analyze a code base using a clean object oriented api

#### 2 - Clarpse is powerful, All types and components are resolved at parse time

#### 3 - A consistent source model data format regardless of input programming language
No matter what input language is being parsed, Clarpse will always generate the same OOPSourceCodeModel object that abstracts away any language specific details. Clarpse is designed to be modular and extensible, new languages can be added with little effort.
