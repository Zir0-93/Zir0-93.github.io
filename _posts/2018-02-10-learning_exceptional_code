It is well known that APIs need developer-friendly docs in order
to gain widespread adoption. However, little if any improvement in the REST API visualization methods have been made over the

are simply listed, one after another within categories. This format does a good job of communicating the low-level details of each endpoint; However, 
when dealing with increased API complexity, developers need a way to get a high level understanding of the API **before** diving down into those
low-level details.
