The Object Oriented Programming [OOP] paradigm is often associated with many great programming concepts
including polymorphism, encapsulation and composition to name a few. However, even with a little experience in
a functional programming language like haskell for example, you would quickly realize that these techniques are not exclusive to OOP at all. 
If that is the case, then what ideas does OOP bring forward that make it so well known and widely adopted in the industry?<!--more-->
To answer this question,
the early discussions of Alan Kay, commonly recognized for having coined the term "Object Oriented Programming", will be analyzed.
Interestingly enough, many of the concepts Alan envisioned as being central to OOP are not found in most
software projects and certainly not in any languages that claim to be object oriented today.

### OOP Was Inspired By Biology
Alan Kay's notion of OOP was heavily influenced by his background in Biology. It's inital conception was modeled around the functioning of
biological cells in the human body: 
```
"I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages."
```
Through this single model alone, Alan described a radically different understanding of OOP in comparison to today's understanding
of the concept. To illustrate this point further, Alan says, 
```
"OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things."
```
This model differs with the mainstream understanding of OOP in two main areas: **inter-module communication** and the **role of objects** in a system.

## Inter-Object Communication
Objects are commonly thought as central to the understanding of OOP, that's probably why its called **Object** oriented programming - except its not.
In fact, it is this idea that has caused many to misunderstand what is actually at the core of OOP:
```
"The key in making growable system has much more to do with how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties are."
```
Moreover, this communication between modules must take place through messaging.
```
"It's not even about classes. I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term objects for this topic because it gets too many people
focussed on the lesser idea. The big idea is messaging."
```
A method call was not the way modules in an OOP system 
intended to communicate, rather it was through messaging - and yes, there is a significant difference between the two.
The difference is in the way we percieve method calls versus messages. Calling a method essentially puts the person making the method
call in control of running the process. The caller gets the callee to do something and prevents it from doing something that the caller
does not want. Message passing on the other hand revolves around **negotiation**, and this is the key in building object oriented systems.

**Method calling vs content negotiation via message passing**

Because of method calling, we've trained ourselves to develop systems where a single or group of classes are primarily responsible for
controlling the software and gettings done. By thinking about communication between modules through **messages**, we are more likely to 
build systems composed of independant intelligent objects that communicate with each other to accomplish tasks - no single unit is responsible
for running the show.

## The Role of Objects
One of the main principles in object oriented systems today invovles modelling objects after living things. And yet, most object oriented
systems fail to achieve this goal in many ways. Consider the code example reproduced below taken from a 
[tutorial on encapsulation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_encapsulation.htm) 
by a well known website on programming. This example is thought to demonstrate encapsulation because the ```age``` private field variables are not accessible
directly. Rather, external callers must access the field variable through a public method.

```java

/* File name : EncapTest.java */
public class EncapTest {

   private int age;

   public int getAge() {
      return age;
   }

   public void setAge( int newAge) {
      age = newAge;
   }
}

```

And yet, this is a poor example of encapsulation because this class can be
torn apart by other objects. Anyone can read its internal data and
inject new data into it through its setters. 
Therefore, the core reason as to why encapsulation is not preserved is because of the use of getters and 
setters. The reason why getters and setters are commonly used and taught in OOP is because of a fundamental misunderstanding
of real life objects.

That is to say, we often model objects as dumb, incapable, data-holding objects with methods. Our objects are usually not self contained,
and rely on a large network of other objects and data to perform thier function properly. However, Alan Kay envisioned
objects to be intelligent, independent and self contained units - like computers on a network or the cells in our body. 
They are living organisms, with their own behavior, properties and a life cycle. But most importantly, they are in control of
their internals and they run their own show. 

This idea immidiately clashes with the way objects are designed in a modern object oriented system because Alan Kay's objects
would prefer immutability. Rather than having their state changed at the will of any external force through getters and setters,
objects should be self contained and hide internal data properly. A living organism does not allow anyone from the outside
to change its properties (they can request to do so however). Alan's visions of objects also clashes with inheritance
as the use of inheritance results in dependant and thus fragile objects that are highly coupled to their inheritance hierarchy. Again,
this goes against the notion of having independant, self-contained objects. There’s a great quote by Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang:

```
"The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle."
```
## The Actor Model

To conclude, the implementation of the ideas behind messaging combined with the creation of self-contained, intelligent objects will give rise to truly OOP systems. Systems, that will
actually demonstrate the information hiding mechanism promised by encapsulation. 
If you would like to see a computational model that closely resembes what Alan Kay envisioned in OOP, take a look at
the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).
