The Object Oriented Programming [OOP] paradigm is often associated with many wonderful programming ideas 
including polymorphism, encapsulation and composition to name a few. However, an individual with little experience in
a functional programming language like haskell for example, will quickly realize that these techniques are not exclusive to OOP at all. <!--more-->
If that is the case, then what ideas does OOP bring forward that make it so special? Why should one OOP? To answer this question,
the early discussions of Alan Kay, largely recongnized as to have coined the term "Object Oriented Programming", will be put forward.
As we wil see, many of the concepts and benefits Alan associated with his original understanding of OOP are not present in most
software projects and certainly not in any languages that claim to be object oriented today.
