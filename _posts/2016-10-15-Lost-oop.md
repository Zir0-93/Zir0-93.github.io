The Object Oriented Programming [OOP] paradigm is often associated with many wonderful programming ideas 
including polymorphism, encapsulation and composition to name a few. However, an individual with little experience in
a functional programming language like haskell for example, will quickly realize that these techniques are not exclusive to OOP at all. <!--more-->
If that is the case, then what ideas does OOP bring forward that make it so special? Why should one OOP? To answer this question,
the early discussions of Alan Kay, commonly recognized for having coined the term "Object Oriented Programming", will be analyzed.
Interestingly enough, many of the concepts and benefits Alan associated with his original understanding of OOP are not present in most
software projects and certainly not in any languages that claim to be object oriented today.

### OOP Was Inspired By Biology
Alan Kay's notion of OOP was heavily influenced by his background in Biology. It's inital conception was modeled around the functioning of
biological cells in the human body: 
```
"I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages."
```
Through this single model alone, Alan described a radically different of understanding of OOP in comparison to today's understanding
of the concept. To illustrate this point further, Alan says, 
```
"OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things."
```
To understand these differences better, we will analyze Alan's vision of OOP through three main areas.

## Messaging
