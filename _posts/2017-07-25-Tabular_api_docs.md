It is no surprise that APIs need high quality docs in order
to gain widespread adoption. However, little if any improvement in the way API are presented to developers have been made over the 
past few years. Nowadays, most API docs and developer portals adopt a [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/) type of format where all the endpoints in the specification
are simply listed, one after another. This format does a good job of communicating the low level details of each endpoint; However, 
as the complexity of APIs grows, developers need a way to get a high level understanding of the API **before** diving down into those
low level details.
